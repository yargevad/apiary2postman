apiary2postman
==============

Tool for generating a Postman collection from an API Blueprint, or an API Blueprint hosted on Apiary.

Supports

  * [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org)
  * [API Blueprint AST](https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint-ast), which can be generated by [Drafter](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter)
  * Fetching an API Blueprint from Apiary API

    
# Prerequisites

[Drafter](https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter) < 2.0 is required if you want to use API Blueprint/Apiary API.

To install on OS X:

    brew install --HEAD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apiaryio/drafter/b3dce8dda5d48b36e963abeffe5b0de7afecac3d/tools/homebrew/drafter.rb
    
To install from source:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/apiaryio/drafter
    cd drafter
    git checkout b3dce8d # This is the commit for release 0.1.9
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Drafter is used to convert Blueprint API to JSON. The preferred version is v0.1.9.
Drafter v2 changed the JSON output format to be incomptabile with apiary2postman.
Feel free to submit a pull request which fixes this.

# Installation

    pip install apiary2postman

### Or, run from your checkout

    git clone <repo-url>
    cd apiary2postman/apiary2postman
    ./apiary2postman.py <args>

# Usage

    apiary2postman json blueprint.json --output postman.json

##### If you have the API Blueprint, use the `blueprint` subcommand:

    apiary2postman blueprint some.blueprint > postman.dump
  
###### It is also possible to pipe everything:

    cat some.blueprint | apiary2postman blueprint > postman.dump

##### To generate a total Postman environment dump from Apiary API, use the `api` subcommand with your Apiary API name:
 
    apiary2postman api my_api > my_api.dump

##### To ignore certain Apiary API resource groups, use `--exclude` (case-insensitive substring match):

    apiary2postman --exclude 'IGNORE ME' --exclude 'ME TOO' api my_api > my_api.dump

##### By default, `apiary2postman` creates one collection per resource group. `--one-collection` allows you to specify the name of a container collection. Folders are created w/in this collection using the resource group names, and requests are added to the folders. Caveat: resources - that would otherwise determine the folder names - are ignored.

    apiary2postman --combine 'My Combined API' api my_api > my_api.dump

##### If you don't have an API key, log in to [your Apiary account](https://apiary.io), go to Settings, scroll down to Tokens. Generate one if needed, and set the environment variable `APIARY_API_KEY` to that hex string.

    APIARY_API_KEY=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff apiary2postman api my_api > my_api.dump

###### Or to generate only a Postman collection from Apiary API:

    apiary2postman --only-collection api my_api > my_api.collection

It's also possible to specify the output file using the `--output`.

##### If you have the API Blueprint AST already generated, use the `json` subcommand:

    apiary2postman json some.json > postman.dump
    
###### It is also possible to pipe everything:

    cat some.json | apiary2postman json > postman.dump

# Contribution

Contributions are greatly appreciated. What is most lacking is tests and would be super-grealy appreciated.
